## Inspiration

It is Labor Day 2018 and I had just finished 3 hours of pickup basketball. On my walk home I thought to myself why there did not exist any applications geared to helping people locate nearby basketball courts. And not just find courts, but also help organize games and communication with other players in the area. My thoughts, now abetted from the dopamine release which follows intense competition and victory, remained dancing around this topic as I dribbled my basketball up 20 Manhattan blocks along the east river. That night I continued brainstorming and started fleshing out these ideas.
